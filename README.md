# TypeScript Utilities for CRUD Applications

This library serves as a comprehensive toolkit for building CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications in TypeScript. It provides a range of
utilities designed to accelerate the development process, allowing you to focus on the unique aspects of your application while the boilerplate code
is efficiently handled.

## Overview

The library is modular, organized into distinct layers and functionalities:

- **DAO (Data Access Object)**: Base implementations for generic data access operations, offering both a standard interface (`GenericDAO`) and a
  PouchDB-specific implementation (`GenericPouchDAO`).

- **Mappers**: Utility for mapping between datastore and domain models, facilitating data transformation.

- **Errors**: A robust error-handling module that includes custom error classes, an error type enumeration, and utility functions for error creation
  and handling.

- **Model**: The starting point for crafting domain models (`Entity` and `PouchEntity`), providing a consistent structure for your application's data.

- **Password Utilities**: Helper functions for hashing and verifying passwords, encapsulated in the `PasswordUtils` class.

- **String Utilities**: A collection of string manipulation functions, ranging from capitalization to email validation.

With these foundational elements, you can extend and adapt the library to fit the specific requirements of your CRUD application, whether you're
building DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), domain models, or implementing other common operations.

# DAO

The DAO (Data Access Object) layer is responsible for abstracting the interaction with the data source. In this project, the DAO layer is implemented
using PouchDB.

## Classes

### `GenericDAO` Interface

This interface defines the standard CRUD operations along with some additional utility methods.

#### Methods

- `create(doc: D): Promise<D>`: Creates a new document of type `D`.
- `getOne(id: string): Promise<D>`: Retrieves a single document by its ID.
- `getAll(): Promise<D[]>`: Retrieves all documents.
- `update(doc: D): Promise<D>`: Updates an existing document.
- `delete(id: string): Promise<void | string>`: Deletes a document by its ID.
- `getNextSequenceId(sequenceId: string): Promise<number>`: Gets the next sequence ID for a given sequence.
- `getMany(ids: string[]): Promise<D[]>`: Retrieves multiple documents by their IDs.
- `findByField(fieldName: string, value: any): Promise<D[]>`: Finds documents by a specific field.

---

## Transaction Module

### Transaction Interface

The `Transaction` interface provides a contract for transaction management within a CRUD application. It ensures that all operations within a
transaction are atomic and consistent.

#### Methods

- `registerUndo(undoFunction: UndoFunction)`: Registers an undo function that will be called if the transaction needs to be rolled back.
- `rollback()`: Rolls back the transaction, reverting all the operations performed during the transaction.
- `commit()`: Commits the transaction, making all the operations permanent.
- `release()`: Releases any resources held by the transaction.

### TransactionManager Class

It's a factory class for creating transaction objects based on the DAO provided.

#### Methods

- `createTransaction(dao: GenericDAO<any>): Transaction`: Creates a transaction object based on the type of DAO provided.

### PouchTransaction and TypeORMTransactionWrapper Classes

These classes implement the `Transaction` interface, one for PouchDB and the other for TypeORM.

### Generic ORM DAO

The `GenericOrmDAO` class provides a set of CRUD operations using TypeORM as the underlying ORM.

- `update(doc: D, transaction?: Transaction)`: Updates an existing document.
- `delete(id: string, transaction?: Transaction)`: Deletes a document by its ID.
- `getNextSequenceId(counterDocId: string, maxRetries: number)`: Gets the next sequence ID for a given sequence.
- `getMany(ids: string[])`: Retrieves multiple documents by their IDs.
- `findByField(fieldName: string, value: any)`: Finds documents by a specific field.

### GenericOrmDoc Class

The base class for documents that will be stored using TypeORM.

#### Fields

- `id`: The unique identifier for the document.

- `createdDate`: The date the document was created.
- `updatedDate`: The date the document was last updated.

### `GenericPouchDAO` Class

Implements the `GenericDAO` interface and provides additional functionalities specific to PouchDB.

#### Methods

- `getNextSequenceId(counterDocId: string): Promise<number>`: Gets the next sequence ID from a counter document.
- `createIndex(field: string): Promise<void>`: Creates an index on a field for optimized querying.
- `getAll(): Promise<D[]>`: Retrieves all documents of the entity type.
- `getOne(docId: string): Promise<D>`: Retrieves a single document by its ID.
- `getMany(docIds: string[]): Promise<D[]>`: Retrieves multiple documents by their IDs.
- `create(doc: D): Promise<D>`: Creates a new document.
- `update(doc: D): Promise<D>`: Updates an existing document.
- `restore(doc: D): Promise<D>`: Restores a deleted document.
- `delete(docId: string): Promise<string>`: Deletes a document by its ID.
- `bulkSave(docs: GenericPouchDoc[]): Promise<GenericPouchDoc[]>`: Performs a bulk save operation on an array of documents.
- `findByField(fieldName: string, value: any): Promise<D[]>`: Finds documents by a specific field.

### `ValidatingPouchDAO` Class

Extends `GenericPouchDAO` and adds schema validation for documents.

#### Methods

- `getSchema(): Joi.ObjectSchema`: Returns the Joi schema for document validation.
- `create(doc: D): Promise<D>`: Creates a new document with validation.
- `update(doc: D): Promise<D>`: Updates an existing document with validation.

### `GenericPouchMapper` Class

Provides utility methods for converting between PouchDB documents and domain models.
